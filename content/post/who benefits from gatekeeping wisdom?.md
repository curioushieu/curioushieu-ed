> “Is wisdom derived from experience more or less valuable than data produced by controlled research? What research should we allow into our professional journals and what should we reject?”

> “when faced with either-or dilemmas, the first question we should ask is, **Who benefits by forcing people to choose**?”

> “f you applied the *Who benefits?* question to the debate in social work, the answer was clear: **Traditional quantitative researchers benefited** if the profession decided their work was the only path to truth.”

—Brené Brown, *Rising Strong*
