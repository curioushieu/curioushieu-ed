### what was the process of learning good discovery like? especially when you weren't as good as now?
- used to be uncomfortable speaking to people he didn't know
- address fear of people -> references [[Fear Setting]]
- be comfortable with your voice
- energy shifts depending on how you use your tone and body language

### why is discovery so important and what are the missed opportunities
- lack of preparation makes it difficult to be confident and control pace and direction of conversation
- care about what the prospect is caring about
- less than 1% of sales calls have good disco

### Goals of good discovery call
- have a consistent strong opener
- how would you want them to reply to that email?
- what do you want the prospect to feel, do, say at end of call?
- at end of outbound discovery, want the prospect to feel it was worth the time to speak further
  - wow this was informative
  - i learned something today
  - i like this person
  - this was interesting to me
  - my time would be spent well if i gave them more of it
- want to secure next steps and find a meaningful gap
- understand some initiatives of that customer
- potential use case or two that we could bring into the next call, and why that matters so much

#### likeability as a salesperson vs. trust
- i like your style, personality, vibe. i like you person.
- how do you gain that likeability?
  - if you're not fun to talk to, people won't want to get on calls with you regardless of how smart and impactful you are
- makes having hard chats and asking for referrals easier if there's a solid rapport and positiive working relationship

#### B2b is the same as b2c, only longer, more complex sales cycle
- more steps, more people, bigger budgets


## prep before discovery

### Ethan Parker's 3-layers of prep

#### pillar 1: information
- understand what the company does and how they make money
- describe what they do in a way that makes sense to a non industry professional

#### pillar 2: individual
- time in role
- background
- who they've worked with
- connected to anyone in network
- what do they brag about
- what do they engage with

#### pillar 3: other stakeholders 
- take a peek on LinkedIn Nav
- write some names down of other stakeholders that you can reference and ask for a direct referral to 
- most neglected part of prep

### why prepare before cold-call / discovery?
- looking for triggers and trends to increase understanding of executive leadership of that company, what their mindset is
- doesn't matter how much they're funded because doesn't mean they'll have budget 
- re: funding: if you raised a bunch of capital last year, you're in hardcore growth mindset vs. if your last raise was 5 years ago, front of your mind will be less on growth and other more complex initiatives
- how long people have been in their role


## how prep plays in discovery calls

### intro
leverage prep to build rapport
- yes, they like you beyond pleasantries.
- see you immediately as sharp, have your shit together both personally and business acumen

#### building rapport to demonstrate business acumen
- i did do some homework, let me share what i know, let me know if i'm off base
  - just ipo'd last year, 190 mil
  - most of your sales leadership within 6 months onboarding, 10 SDRs right now, you're 4 months into the role
  - typically means that they've never had sales development motion before, or it didn't work out before. does that resonate with you or am i just off base?
- allow them to correct you

#### upfront contract
- might be 5 mins after building rapport before you drop some of the prepwork you've uncovered about prospect

> hey prospect, thanks for catching me up to speed. i know you've got a lot going on today. would it be helpful if i add some context for the call today?

> based on what you've told me, i can tell you about this other similar company that has THIS OUTCOME related to PAIN POINT

I'm going to show you how...

#### the language used to tell the story
- I thought it would be helpful to...
- Together we can... discuss whether it makes sense to dive in further...
- If not, know that you'll be able to take away some valuable insights
- Anything else that you'd like to cover today to make this worth your time?
  - maintain control but make the prospect feel in control at the same time
- customer centric. similar company pointed out that...
  - through entire call

### discovery
outbound especially
- ask deeper questions
- use "what" and "how" based questions to find the "why"
- suggestions, raise issues, value drivers, create dialogue

#### roles and goals
- i speak to a lot of people in (same position as yourself), don't want to make any assumptions, do you mind sharing a bit more about your role and a couple of key goals you have for your team for the next 12 months?
- this uncovers great stuff if you've built your rapport
- what is the "why?" 
  - use "how" and "what" based questions
  - understand the significance, invite detailed answers, 
  - pattern interrupt to pause and let prospect think
  - show authentic curiosity to learn 

#### value drivers - connect to larger initiative or goal
- might know what bucket they're in
- offer suggestions. 
  - *earlier you mentioned 100% increase in pipeline, other folks with similar goals typically 1. going SDR route bc AEs aren't prospecting how they need to, theyre having a hard time getting AEs to prospect. 2. conversion rates are low, sitting at 20% call move to next steps, then closing only 10% of that, resulting only in 3% close rate. is that surprising to you or what is your experience?*
- buying decisions are made, and you will shorten your sales cycle, if you can connect to the key initiative that is already on teh road map for this year
  - outcome, initiative, project now or in near future that you can attach to and poke and prod around that
  - not always put to a deadline, these connecting projects aren't always available

#### get gap acknowledgment of where you are vs. where you'd like to be
- create detailed way of how big the gap is, start to quantify the gap. now it becomes urgent that needs a project to be created around it.
- build the gap - [[Keenen, 2018 - Gap Selling]]

#### customer story is woven into the process
- these outcomes and issues; you are offering things you're hearing from other people. this makes me more comfortable sharing with you.
- when you talk about problems that other companies are having, seeing if it resonates with prospect at all, makes prospect feel more comfortable to share that they haven't got it all figured out yet. can be vulnerable to share bc empathy is already there

#### get an emotional gap established but offer value 
- get a basis started and continue working on it in the next call
- have enough gap to sell the next conversation, then move on

#### what if prospect isn't opening up? or they don't know?
- probably not opening up because call isn't centered on the customer
- *maybe i'm missing the mark today, should i give you some time back?* just call it out and ask. they can say, they'd like to get off the call. can get prospect to re-engage with you if you're honest and upfront



### closing, why you - storytelling
*see  [[Miller - Building a Storybrand]]*

#### leverage the story to talk about next steps
- raised issues, drove value, acknowledged gap
- 5-7 mins share story from relevant customer
  - tell story in relevant way
  - paint picture that this customer is world class, this is what world class looks like
  - they started at A, then they realized they got to B stage and now they have new issues that they fixed this way, then they got to C issue, now they're at D and now they're at this outcome now.
  - what we learned is we can skip straight A to D. that's us.

### next steps
7 minutes before call ends, phone alarm goes off.
- lay out an agenda for the next call
- get referrals to other stakeholders
- talk about the buying process
- give insight on timeline
---

- prospect, i'm out of time!
  - set alarms for all your sales calls, when they need to be closed out
- summary of pain, gain, impact
  - summary of the call is impactful
  - succinct and concise replay and reframe of prospect's issues reframed as solvable by your solution
- anything you want to add or takeaway?
- based on that, i see a strong potential for us to be helpful. would you agree it makes sense to dive in a little bit more?
  - not sure if the timing is right, but do you think a conversation makes sense?
- for the next call, we will cover HOW we do XYZ, how we'll get you ROI and justify the cost
- your CFO will want to be on the call as well. would that be Jane? or Dave? 
  - do the work, set the agenda. this is when we are going to talk next time. 
- anything gonna change or happen between now and our next call?
- send quick summary or video that you can send to other people, or material you can reference
  - create notion doc to link summary, bullets, references, any other links that come up
