## 1. build product knowledge 
clients expect sales reps to know products inside and out.

Overcome the objection: Demonstrate the unique value of your product, and give specific examples of how the product will solve a problem for the customer.

Need: “I’m happy with my current setup.”
Complacency, or an actual fear of change, can lead many potential buyers to dismiss a product before they’ve learned what it can do for them and their business. Remember that complacency is often a result of being ill-informed about a problem or opportunity, so if a potential customer seems complacent, you will need to take the extra time to describe the overarching problem or opportunity in depth.

Overcome the objection: If you can, bring up examples or case studies about their competitors who have made some recent changes similar to the one you are suggesting. Fear of change is a natural reaction, so you will need to calm the customer’s concern by showing examples of positive change within the client’s industry to provide a boost of confidence.

The best way to learn your products is by reviewing product demos, press releases, and documentation. Then, use them. Ask developers or product managers questions about functionality, use cases, and potential pitfalls. Write your own notes highlighting standout features and the problems they solve for customers.
