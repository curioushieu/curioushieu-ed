*pandora’s box is closed right now. but are you under the impression that you live outside of the box or inside the box?*

you’re living in pandora’s box and you’ve asked me to come here to open it up. we’re not gonna walk through this process without walking through some deep shit. there’s gonna be deep, swift waters.

we all grew up and experienced at varying degrees: *trauma, disappointment, hell*. hard stuff. we armored up. and at some point, that armor no longer serves us. how is not talking about this serving you?

**the armor is not serving you anymore.** the weight of the armor is too heavy. it’s not protecting you; it’s keeping you from being known and seen by others.

this is the question. this is when the universe comes down, puts their hands on your shoulders, pulls you close, whispers in your ear, “i’m not fucking around. you’re halfway to dead. the armor is keeping you from growing into the gifts i’ve given you. that is not without penalty. time is up.”

this is what you see happens to people in mid-life. **it’s not a crisis. it’s a slow, brutal unraveling.** this is where everything that we thought protects us keeps us from being the partners, the parents, the professionals, the people that we want to be. this is a fork in the road.
