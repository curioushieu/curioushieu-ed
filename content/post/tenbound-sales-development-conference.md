*unedited notes*

## what would your perfect day look like?
1. don't touch your phone for the first hour
2. drink water for first 2 hours
	1. coffee interferes with your cortisol
3. drink coffee
4. exercise while listening to podcasts


what has prospect tried
what do they know that could work
what are they not doing that could work
what are they putting off

ask other questions and read in between teh lines

even if you ask someone what theitr perfect avg day, they might not know

a lot of people don't know what they want.

if you have a product that could help future version of them, that would help them become who they want to become.

## how to optimize SDR team performance using 
with Zack Thompsom, Director of Sales Development at ZoomInfo
- 4.5 years, started as SDR
- works in emerging products and expansion as they're building out new specialized selling teams as they take new products to market

### ZoomInfo is a data company
 ![[Screen Shot 2022-06-02 at 8.49.09 AM.png]]

- what's accurate
- what's useful

### Revenue Operating System

![[Screen Shot 2022-06-02 at 8.50.36 AM.png]]

- ZoomInfo - data cloud
	- issue => hard to be efficient and scale when you only have data
- Move data where it needs to go to be acted upon
	- operations
	- CRM hygeine
	- CRM enrichment
	- lead routing
	- get data from all of it's creation points, website app marketing automation platform, digital ad campaigns => standardizing, normalizing the data so sales, marketing, recruiters can make sense of it
- Act upon the data in a way that's intelligent and valuable

### Biggest Day-to-Day Challenges for SDRs
- prioritizing warm and cold outreach to maximize success of emailing and calling prospects
- researching prospects early to ask the right questions to uncover pain points and personalize your conversations
	- where to look, what info is useful and what's not
	- how do we show up relevant?
- finding the best people to connect with, at the right time
	- how to understand what decision making committee is at company without talking to someone at company
	- how do i map out stakeholders as SDR so i can run that sales cycle quickly
- qualifying leads to book meetings for Account Executives
	- understanding when right time to connect is
	- when someone is still in discovery phase vs active buying cycle vs doing research on shortlist of vendors prospect will reach out to
- following up on opportunities that have had no recent activity, but still may be warm
	- keeping opportunities warm over time
	- great resignation; people are moving jobs all the time
		- => impact on sales, longer sales cycles. main point of contact at company may end up leaving and your opportunity is dead unless you're multi-threaded and have mechanism to find a new champion right away
		- don't have to clear cold contacts from pipeline if we can work opportunities that are open and instead get additional stakeholders involved

### the old way to build GTM
- relied on relationship selling
	- over dinner, face to face, shook hands
- lack of KPI's and ability to track
	- couldnt track what was efficient, what was working
- maybe use of CRM / not all sales folks use it efficiently, or not thorough
	- CRM full of incomplete and inaccurate info not useful to anyone

### The Modern Revenue Operating System


![[Screen Shot 2022-06-02 at 9.01.31 AM.png]]


#### Actionable Insights
- who to engage with
- when
- what message

#### CRM: revenue operations platform
- call every inbound lead within 90 seconds at ZoomInfo (SLA)
	- use orchestration to pull all data on leads + info on form fill, standardize in one place for outreach to inbound lead
	- longer waiting to engage leads, less likely to close
	- call them before they've left your website and moved on with their day


### Data / Tech-Driven Optimization
![[Screen Shot 2022-06-02 at 9.05.08 AM.png]]

#### Demand Gen Marketing
- Running campaigns, doing conference events, cold email

#### Rev Gen build campaigns
- enriching zoom info data


### key takeaways
- get to buyers early when they are getting ready to buy
	- drive inbound leads and act quickly
- uncover opportunities that may not be as cold as it seems on the surface
- research and learn of prospect's pain points and needs to personalize your message
- find ways to optimize your process to spend more time prospectingl


- less qualification
- want SDRs to have convo with prospects before convo with AE
- understand if it's a good fit
- understand challenges and problems trying to solve
	- if can't ask that in form fill, no good way to get that info

### Don't ever read a deck as a SDR
- be familiar with deck that AEs use
- use pieces of the deck when talking to prospects
- don't read off the deck
- can give teaser of demo deck
- DO DISCOVERY AND UNCOVER PAIN POINTS before demo can make any sense
	- what they're responsible for at the company
	- what the company is trying to accomplish
- RECORD A VIDEO: wanted to tease this before our meeting tmrw. know in our call you're interested in breaking into xyz account. wanted to show you some finance decision makers. 
	- show self running search and getting the contact in 20 seconds to get them excited for the meeting.


## How to avoid SDR Burnout

### How Jill Bruno avoids Burnout
- Manager, Sales Development, RocketReach
- Manages people, has human approach w SDRs
	- connect 1:1
	- what are they going thru
	- what's going on in personal life that could impact professional life
	- how to reduce burnout in any area of life

### Joe Venuti, 
- VP Sales Development, UpKeep
- have 1:1s lunch happy hours: no work talk
- drive engagement and drive organic friendships
- lead from the front; show your team that you also take time off
- define what it takes to move forward

### Zack Thompson, how can smaller startups build career pathways for SDRs
- micro promotions: SDRs start on inbound teams, booking inbound meetings for AEs. move to outbound team. then move to account executive, account manager. go to recruiting or finance.
	- specializing roles as you scale. inbound or outbound. 
	- product or solution that applies to multiple market segments, then start on SMB then move to midMarket, Enterprise etc.
- make a clear path, this is what it looks like to go from inbound to outbound
- foster relationships with decision makers, AE leadership side so you can get reps familiar with who they'll be working for
- require reps to take a day or two off each quarter... 

### Eden Richardson
- set clear expectations, expect accountability
- tie back to your goals, aspirations for why you're in sales
- more motivating for reps not to be micro managed

how can company support your personal goals outside of work?

## Tactics for building pipeline in 2022 with LeadIQ

![[Screen Shot 2022-06-02 at 9.47.44 AM.png]]

Ryan O'Hara uses creative thinking

### When a prospect asks you to send more info, *ask them what kind of info would be valuable to them*
- Hype your next touch / email you're about to write, "this is gonna be the best email you've ever seen"
- the people you prospect into have interesting backgrounds
	- be thoughtful with your prospecting. make the person feel special

### Keep it real. Don't do gimmicks.
- average reply rate less than 1%
- average connect rate less than 3%
- hurts trust

![[Screen Shot 2022-06-02 at 9.50.35 AM.png]]

### What makes a good subject line?
- personalized and vague
- set the expectation of your cold email's body
- more about the prospect than you
- don't use "marketing jargon"
	- write how you'd actually write
	- don't worry about proper grammar and capitalization rules
- be something you'd want to receive in your inbox

### line up your value prop based on your research
- don't fake personalization. be specific when you reach out.

### talk about what you found researching your prospect
- I saw you...
- Read your post about...
- Noticed you had talked to xyz a few months ago (be specific)

### don't pitch in your LinkedIn Connection request
- mention what you noticed about the person
- what called to you on their profile

### reference something personal about how you found them


### when you get accepted on LinkedIn, use another channel to pitch first

### make your first touch your best one, hype it up with your follow up


### say your name last when you leave a voicemail
- pattern interrupt bc they're curious who is calling
- ppl are reading vm's over transcription service

### talk about what you said in an email or voicemail during your followup
- if you emailed a video or relevant article, reference back to it in your voicemail

### be yourself
- don't speak language of marketing
- align on value props
- find way to make connection in their personalization with their own experiences

### put yourself in your prospecting outreach to find common ground. reference your own related hobbies, interests
- what do you have in common with your prospect?   


### director level or below, focus on your prospect's own interests vs the company's

### when asking for a referral, ask for a specific person!!!
- look at prospect's connections and ask for specific people

### measure your rep's prospecting effiuciency score
- the # of responses someone has divided by number of touches. multiplied by number of opportunities someone has divided by number of responses.
- number of opportunities divided by number of touches = prospecting efficiency score

![[Screen Shot 2022-06-02 at 10.03.33 AM.png]]

- if high response rate but low qualification rate, train them on objection handling

### lead every touch with why the prospect is special to you
- why did you pick them?

### prospect LinkedIn Engagements
- reps should be posting every 6 days online.
	- personal stories
	- ask open ended questions
	- people who engage with your posts, prospect them

### ask open ended questions


## open the conversation after LinkedIn connection request accepted
- go to their activity and ask their opinion on something they've engaged with
- saw on your activity you posted on X topic, what are your thoughts on that?
- google "trends on xyz" prospect's industry

### personalizing 
- fallback to current events on what's happening in their company
- personalize based on location, where they've worked before, look at job postings for company. useful to figure out what they're looking for. talk about what they sell. ways you could bring up their inventory

### connection without engagement
- if someone doesn't respond on LI
	- look at their social activity
	- look for mutual interest
	- mutual connections
	- any intereaction
	- look at their LI recommendations
	- add all your coworkers on LI
- find someone else that works at their company and ask what your prospect is like
	- find something unique about prospect
	- READ PURPLE COW
- always cold call someone - did you happen to check email yet? sent you an email, reference the personalization that you sent in the email
