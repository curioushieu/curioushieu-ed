do you ever get the feeling that you don't remember who you are anymore?

especially when depression repeatedly forced you into isolation.

these days,
you recognize your triggers and symptoms. 
you've learned helpful coping tools.

you feel joy. 
sometimes every day for days on end.
and yet.
it comes back sometimes.

when you finally make it on the other side,
it feels like you're starting all over. again.

do you truly exist if no one knows how much you've changed?
who you've worked so hard to become?

how do you know if you've changed for better?
trauma has forced you to adapt to so many situations. 
of what's left, what's yours? what's toxic and better left behind?

make a list of what matters to you.
your values and principles. your mission.

something to look back on when depression and anxiety trick you
into believing that you're not worthy, you're lesser than.

remember what's important to you.
ammunition against the lies.
home base to return to.

you know why you're here.
don't forget: you matter.
you're enough.
