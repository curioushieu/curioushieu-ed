Hi, I'm hieu nguyen (they/them).

Based on my upbringing in a small town in the San Francisco East Bay, as part of a war torn immigrant Vietnamese family, I have always appreciated the resilience & perseverance to survive against the odds, even with a lack of possibility models.  
  
I studied Sociology and Ethnic Studies and pursued a curiosity for how people relate to one another, where I learned how to ask hard-to-answer questions to unlock potential in others.  
  
I pursued a career in client success & sales, which taught me how to listen with curiosity, consult based on people's problems, and persuade folks to forge a values aligned path forward despite overwhelming fear.  
  
By overcoming CPTSD and severe depression I learned how to develop coping strategies specific to living with intergenerational trauma which brings me an appreciation for the privilege of literacy & curiosity to pursue self-taught education on recovering from trauma.Â   
  
All this experience has led me to write about coping with CPTSD in order to help people thrive while living with intergenerational trauma, without repeating the same mistakes that I made.
