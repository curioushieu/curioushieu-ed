> The only thing that inches you toward a sale is **proving that you understand your customers’ problems and the impact of those problems**, that you know why they’re struggling, that you understand why they’re not happy with their current state, that **you hold the key to moving them to the future state they desire**, and that the change they are facing will be worth the money and effort it takes to get there.

> They want to know how you’re going to make their lives better. They want you to prove that you understand their needs and can **provide a customized solution that makes the future state look better than the state they’re in right now.**
