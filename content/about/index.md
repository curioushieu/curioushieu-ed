Hi, I'm hieu nguyen (they/them).

I grew up in a small town in the San Francisco East Bay. 

As part of a small Vietnamese-American family, I have always valued the strength and perseverance of immigrants.

I studied Sociology at SFSU. I learned how to dive deep and ask hard-to-answer questions to unlock potential in others.

I pursued a career in sales, where curiosity and empathy enabled collaboration on values alignment.

By overcoming CPTSD, I learned how to heal by creating playbooks for symptom improvement. 

All this experience has led me to write about my experience healing from trauma. 

There's a way to thrive while living with severe depression. 

Hopefully without repeating the same mistakes I made.
