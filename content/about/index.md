Hi! I'm hieu nguyen (they/them).

I grew up in a small town in the San Francisco East Bay. As part of a small immigrant Vietnamese family, I have always valued survival against all odds. 

I studied Sociology at SFSU. I learned how to dive deep and ask hard-to-answer questions to unlock potential in others.

I pursued a career in sales, where curiosity and empathy enabled collaboration on values alignment.

By overcoming CPTSD, I learned how to break the cycle of trauma by creating coping strategies. 

All this experience has led me to write about healing from trauma. 

There's a way to thrive while living with severe depression. 

Hopefully without repeating the same mistakes I made.

## Mission
1. To live life for myself, not the expectations of others.
2. To leave it better than I found it.
3. To get out of my own way.
    
## Values
1. Choose courage.
2. Vulnerability is a strength.
3. Nurture curiosity.
