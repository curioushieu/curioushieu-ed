**Who am I?**

I grew up in a small town in the San Francisco East Bay. As part of an immigrant Vietnamese family, I have always valued survival against all odds. 

I studied Sociology. I learned how to dive deep and ask hard-to-answer questions to unlock potential in others.

I pursued a career in sales, where curiosity and empathy enabled collaboration on values alignment.

By overcoming CPTSD, I learned how to break the cycle of trauma by creating coping strategies. 

All this experience has led me to write about healing strategies. 

There's a way to thrive while living with many traumas. All without repeating the same mistakes I made.
